# To Dos
- [X] Run npm install
- [] Install recommended extensions
- [X] Connect to DB
- [X] Rebuild .env file
- [X] Test Git flow

## To build locally (when I do this again someday...)
- Clone Repo `git clone [repo url]`
- Navigate to directory
- NPM Install - `npm install`
- Update .env file with env variables
    - NOTE: make sure the DB name in the database_url is the same as before
- Run the command `npm run dev`
- Log in using admin login used before 
- For development, it might be helpful to use the recommended extensions for the workspace see `@recommended` in the extensions tab
